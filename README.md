# Workshop PoC Security - OSINT

## Introduction

This workshop is split into two parts:

**GEOINT** — understanding how location intelligence works and practicing with real images

**OSINT** — finding out who a mysterious student is by following clues left online.

Your goal is to think like a real investigator and cross-reference clues !

## GEOINT 🌍

## OSINT 🕵️


### Step 1 - I'm Vengeance

Someone seems very angry at PoC and sent you a mail :
```
You think you can ghost me after the interview ?
I’ll show PoC what a real meltdown looks like.
— I’m Vengeance
```

All we know is that it came from this address : **u6259518657@proton.me** 

**Find out who this mysterious sender** is among the list of students in `students.txt`.


### Step 2 - Find his resume

Perfect ! Now this student has a portfolio containing his **resume** protected somewhere.

Your final objective :  
➡️ **Find the flag inside the PDF.**

Flag format : **`PoC{A Winning Message}`**
